# 👋 Hi, I'm Hüseyin Atılgan

I'm a project manager, not a traditional programmer, but I build projects with the assistance of **Cursor IDE** and its AI capabilities. While I may not have a formal coding background, AI has helped me turn ideas into working solutions with impressive speed.

## 🚀 Who Am I?
- 🧑‍💻 **Digital Project Manager** with a focus on leveraging AI tools to create effective projects.
- 📍 Born in Antalya, currently living in Istanbul.
- 💡 I'm passionate about utilizing AI to simplify the project development process and make it more accessible for non-coders like me.
- 🥁 Outside of work, I'm a drummer and a licensed radio operator.

## 🛠️ Tools I Work With
- **Cursor IDE**: My primary tool. It allows me to create projects by combining my creativity with the power of AI. No need to memorize every line of code—Cursor does most of the work for me.
- **AI-Driven Development**: AI assists with code generation, debugging, and even optimizing solutions, allowing me to focus on project management and creative aspects.
- **Languages & Frameworks**: While I mostly rely on AI to handle the code, I work with tools like PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Cursor guiding me through the process.

## 🌟 Some Projects I've Created;
- [**Real-time Earthquake Tracker**](https://github.com/huseyinatilgan/turkiye-deprem-takip): An application to track earthquake data in Turkey in real-time. Built with the help of AI for quick and efficient development.
- [**Nutrition Exchange Calculator**](https://github.com/huseyinatilgan/nutrition-exchange-calculator): A tool designed for dietitians to easily calculate food exchanges. AI ensured I built a reliable and functional solution.
- [**Uptime Status Dashboard**](https://github.com/huseyinatilgan/uptime-status): A dashboard to monitor the status of services using the UptimeRobot API, developed with AI assistance to ensure precision.

## 🤖 Why I Rely on AI
Even though I don’t come from a traditional coding background, I believe in the power of AI to make programming more accessible. **Cursor IDE** enables me to focus on the bigger picture of my projects, while the AI helps with coding tasks that I would otherwise find challenging.
